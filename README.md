 ## A visual reference for Pyplot API

You know that thing where you're sure there is a command for this or
that in Pyplot, but its name just slips from your head? This repository
 provides a handy image with most commonly
 used functions. Obviously, it's made in Pyplot itself. It is not (and
 isn't intended to be) a comprehensive API documentation; it's just here
 to prevent some googling and/or scrolling through `plt.__dir__()` every
 five seconds.

 #### Note to contributors
 I'd be happy to get some issues or pull requests. Just keep in mind
 that lots of text positions were manually corrected using XKCD mode, so
 fiddling with that (or text sizes) is likely to break something.
