 ## A visual reference for Pyplot API

You know that thing where you're sure there is a command for this or
that in Pyplot, but its name just slips from your head? This repository
 provides a handy image with most commonly
 used functions. Made in Pyplot, obviously. It is not (and
 isn't intended to be) a comprehensive API documentation; it just
 prevents googling and/or scrolling through `plt.__dir__()` every
 five seconds.

 #### Usage

 Run the script to get the image.

 `python3 ./reference.py --format svg --size a3`

 Only A* pages from A0 to A5 are supported; for
 raster file formats the dpi is set to 300.
 Available file formats depend on the installation.

 Tested in Python3.4 and higher.

 #### Note to contributors

 I'd be happy to get some issues or pull requests. Just keep in mind
 that lots of text positions were manually corrected using XKCD mode, so
 fiddling with that (or text sizes) is likely to break something.
